ðŸ“š Online Book Store
This is a static website for an Online Book Store, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a clean, responsive interface where users can browse books by category, view book details, and interact with dynamic elements like a shopping cart and search functionality. While it doesn't include a backend or database, it simulates the core features of a real bookstore to provide a rich user experience on the front end.
